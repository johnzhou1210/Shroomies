     *          - Play wide sweep animation
     *          - Attach sweep attack events to each attack moment
     *          - Sweeping bullets destroy both player and enemy bullets.
     *      - NECK ATTACK
     *          - Play neck attack animation
     *          - Make boss' neck harmful
     *          - Make boss' sprite invulnerable but neck vulnerable
     *      - TRIPLE SHOT
     *          - Play triple shot animation
     *          - Attach triple attack event to attack moment
     *      - ROLLOUT
     *          - Play prepare animation
     *              - Attach event to end of prepare animation to play one of the 3 types of rollouts as listed below.
     *          - Make rolling shell harmful
     *          - Make boss invulnerable
     *          - 3 Types (refer to sketch):
     *              1) Spiral
     *              2) Zig-zag
     *              3) Looping
     * - ATTACK MOVE INTERVAL DECREASES AS HEALTH DECREASES.
     * - MINIONS SPAWN WHEN BOSS IS <= 50% HP.
